# A strange ceiling is the focal point of the room #
#   before you. It's honeycombed with hundreds of  #
#  holes about as wide as your head. They seem to  #
#  penetrate the ceiling to some height beyond a   #
#   couple feet, but you can't be sure from your   #
#                  vantage point.                  #
